101.1	Need to manage speed on surface streets – 25 MPH regulatory speed limit	Speed Compliance	Notify drivers when their speed exceeds the speed limit
101.2	Need to manage speeds on curves –regulatory speed limit	Curve Speed Compliance	"Advise drivers to comply with the speed limit in curves, thus reducing the potential of a rollover and subsequent major traffic incident"
101.3	Need to manage speed in work zones –speed limit	Speed Compliance / Work Zone	"Facilitate widespread adherence to the NYC speed limit. Additional time -of-day reductions, such as those associated with school zones or moving construction (e.g. pothole repair) zones"
102.1	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles	Forward Crash Warning (FCW)	Warn drivers in case of an impending rear-end crash with another vehicle ahead in the same lane and direction of travel
102.2	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles	Emergency Electronics Brake Light (EEBL)	Notify drivers when a vehicle ahead generates an emergency brake event
102.3	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles	Blind Spot Warning (BSW) + Lane Change Warning/Assist (LCA)	Warn the driver of the vehicle if the blind-spot zone is occupied by another vehicle traveling in the same direction during a lane change attempt and when it is not attempted.
102.4	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles	Intersection Movement Assist (IMA)	Warn the driver of a vehicle when it is not safe to enter an intersection because of high crash probability with other vehicles at stop- controlled and uncontrolled intersections.
102.5	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles	Vehicle Turning Right in Front of Bus Warning	"Warn bus drivers of vehicles pulling up behind a stopped bus, making a lane changes to pass around the bus, and exhibiting a path to cross directly in front of the bus"
102.6	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles	Red Light Violation Warning	Advise drivers if a vehicle is on an approach that is likely to result in the vehicle violating the red light
103	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles and infrastructure	Oversize Vehicle Warning	Provides warnings to vehicle drivers to avoid entering a height restricted facility and imminent low clearance location
104.1	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles and pedestrians / bicyclists	Pedestrian in Signalized Crosswalk Warning	Provide in-vehicle indication of pedestrian / bicyclists at intersections equipped with CV technologies
104.2	Need to reduce crashes between vehicles and visually / audibly - impaired pedestrians	Mobile Accessible Pedestrian Signal System (PED -SIG)	Allows for an automated call from the smartphone of a visually impaired pedestrian to the traffic signal and notify approaching drivers of the pedestrian’s presence
105	Need to inform drivers of serious incidents	Evacuation Notification	Provides notification that an area is to be avoided and why (subset of Emergency Communications and Evacuation concepts)
106	Need to provide mobility information in heavily congested areas	Intelligent Traffic Signal System (I - SIGCVDATA)	Integration of CV movements with NYC’s award winning Mid-town In Motion (MIM) adaptive traffic signal system
201	Need to have privacy	Data Normalization	Re-anchor time/location data to protect driver/operator while preserving vehicle trajectory details
202	Need to manage CV application for the traffic environment	CV Application Parameter Control	Manage parameters so that applications can be tuned for the traffic environment
203	Need to manage CV equipment maintenance	NYCDOT to provide equipment and maintain it	Establish a process for managing the installation of equipment and managing the inventory
204	Need to limit additional vehicle cab devices that have the potential to distract drivers	Provide audio warnings for the driver-vehicle interface	Provide either auditory sounds or short voice messages when warnings are triggered
303	Need to notify vehicles of pedestrians	Pedestrian in Signalized Crosswalk	Visually impaired pedestrians want vehicle driver/operator notified due to limited deployment of the technology
401	Need to have trusted communications	Dedicated Short Range Communications and Security Credential Management System	Utilize existing standards and external systems to provide secure information exchanges
402	Need to manage equipment health	RF Monitoring	Equipped vehicles and infrastructure collect first/last contact with other equipped vehicles and infrastructure
403	Need to manage CV application life-cycle	Over-the-Air Firmware Updates	Provide an infrastructure to verify firmware versions and update when necessary
404	Need to manage CV application interrelationship	Configurable threat arbitration level for the CV applications	A configurable arbitration technique will be employed to ensure that the warning with the highest immediate threat is the warning presented to the driver. The arbitration algorithm will be configurable such that additional applications can be added to the ASD.
501	Need to collect detailed information when a warning is issued	Event Recording	Vehicles record the previous X seconds of Basic Safety Message (BSM) data and the next Y seconds of BSM data for evaluation when a CV application issues a warning
502	Need to collect event recordings	Upload Event Recordings	Vehicles initiate uploads of their event recordings when the service is available
503	Need to assess speed compliance	Before/After Speed Compliance Comparison	Record speed compliance warnings events and analyze them
504	Need to assess vehicle-vehicle crashes	Before/After Vehicle-Vehicle Crash Comparison	Record V2V application warning events and analyze them
505	Need to assess vehicle-pedestrian crashes	Before/After Vehicle-Pedestrian Crash Comparison	Record pedestrian crossing warning events and analyze them
506	Need to assess vehicle-infrastructure crashes	Before/After Vehicle-Infrastructure Crash Comparison	Record oversize vehicle warnings and analyze them
510	Need to assess all CV applications	System Performance and Benefits Evaluation	Assess and post -process the data records before sending them to USDOT IE
